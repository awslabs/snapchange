# Snapchange

Lightweight fuzzing of a memory snapshot using KVM

Snapchange provides the ability to load a raw memory dump and register state into a
KVM VM for execution. At a point in execution, this VM can be reset to its initial
state by resetting the dirty pages found by KVM or pages manually dirtied by a
fuzzer.

# Aspirations

* Replay a physical memory and register state snapshot using KVM
* Parallel execution across multiple cores
* Provide a set of introspection features to the guest VM
* Real-time coverage state via breakpoint coverage
* Real-time performance metrics of fuzzer components
* Provide fuzzing utilities such as single-step debug tracing, testcase minimization, and testcase coverage
* Input abstraction to allow custom mutation and generation strategies

# Example:

#### Create a target fuzzer from the fuzzer template

```console
$ cp -r -L fuzzer_template your_new_fuzzer
```

#### Modify `your_new_fuzzer/create_snapshot.sh` to take a snapshot of your target

#### Update `src/fuzzer.rs` to inject mutated data into the guest VM

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
pub struct TemplateFuzzer;

impl Fuzzer for TemplateFuzzer {
    // The type of Input being fuzzed. Used to know how to generate and mutate useful inputs.
    type Input = Vec<u8>;
    // The starting address of the snapshot
    const START_ADDRESS: u64 = 0x402363;
    // The maximum length of mutated input to generate
    const MAX_INPUT_LENGTH: usize = 100;

    fn set_input(&mut self, input: &Self::Input, fuzzvm: &mut FuzzVm<Self>) -> Result<()> {
        // Write the mutated input into the data buffer in the guest VM
        fuzzvm.write_bytes_dirty(VirtAddr(0x402004), CR3, &input)?;
        Ok(())
    }

    fn reset_breakpoints(&self) -> Option<&[BreakpointLookup]> {
        Some(&[
            // Reset when the VM hits example1!main+0x123
            BreakpointLookup::SymbolOffset("example1!main", 0x123)
        ])
    }
}
```

#### Start fuzzing with 16 cores

```console
$ cargo run -r -- fuzz -c 16
```


# Implementation

Quick usage of terms for this README:

* Hypervisor: The target agnostic code executing the snapshot in KVM
* Fuzzer:     The target specific code used to modify and monitor the guest for a target
              specific fuzz case

The hypervisor begins by mapping the physical memory file for each core requested. In
this way, each core has its own, unique copy of memory. The hypervisor then creates the
KVM guest and gives the guest this backing memory. This guest's register state is then
initialized with the given register state and execution of the guest is launched. The
hypervisor waits until the guest exits. Each exit is handled by the hyperisor and some
are passed to the fuzzer for target specific mutation, modification, or introspection. If
the handler of the exit signifies that the guest should be reset, the hyperisor exits the
run loop and resets the guest back to the original snapshot state and restarts the run
loop again.

Coverage of the guest is generated by using coverage breakpoints.  A separate file with a 
list of addresses to breakpoint can be given to the hypervisor. If any of these addresses 
are hit, the address will be added to the coverage database and the instruction for that 
address will be restored. In this way, the breakpoint will not be triggered again.

# Project directory

Snapchange leverages target specific project directories for configuration. This directory
is where input and output files and directories are placed. The following file
extensions/directories are used as inputs:

* `.physmem`    - The file containing the raw, physical memory file
* Register file (one of the following)
    - `.regs` - JSON register file containing the [register state](./docs/REGISTER.md)
    - `.qemuregs` - Output from `info registers` from `qemu`

The full list of files and their uses in the project directory can be found [here](./docs/PROJECT_DIRECTORY.md)

# Debugging Trace

An full example of the debugging single-step trace can be found [here](./docs/DEBUG_TRACE.md).

# Snapshots

Information about obtaining a snapshot via `VirtualBox` or `QEMU` are below:

* [VirtualBox](./docs/VIRTUALBOX_SNAPSHOT.md)
* [QEMU](./qemu_snapshot/README.md)

The examples include a `make_example.sh` (like [example 1](./examples/01_getpid/make_example.sh)) script which goes a full snapshot from scratch. These
examples can be used as a template for other targets for reproducible snapshots.
